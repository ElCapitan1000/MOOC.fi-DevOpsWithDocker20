My favorite programing language is C++.
I created a image from a gcc docker image, https://hub.docker.com/_/gcc.
In the docker file i create a simple cpp program called myApp.cpp, compile and run it.
You can compile a cpp program inside the container with 'g++ -o myApp myApp.cpp' and run it with './myApp'.
The docker image is published under https://hub.docker.com/r/elcapitan1000/gcc_docker .
