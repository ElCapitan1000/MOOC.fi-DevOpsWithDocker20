For this exercise i wrote a buildjob for the frontend application  https://github.com/docker-hy/frontend-example-docker.

The buildjob will download the app to build from https://github.com/ElCapitan1000/app-for-exercise3.3.
The repository consists of the frontend-example-docker and the Dockerfile to build the frontend-example-docker.

To run this exercise clone https://github.com/ElCapitan1000/MOOC.fi-DevOpsWithDocker20/tree/part3/part3/Exercise3.3 and see usedCommands.

The image is published under https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/elcapitan1000/app-from-buildjob-for-exercise3.3
